# Mesop App Runner

The Mesop App Runner is used for running code generated by [Mesop App Maker](https://github.com/richard-to/mesop-app-maker).

## Usage

The Mesop App Runner uses Docker to avoid potentially destructive code changes.

It can be started using these commands:

```shell
docker stop mesop-app-runner;
docker rm mesop-app;
docker build -t mesop-app-runner . && docker run --name mesop-app-runner \
  -e MESOP_APP_RUNNER_TOKEN=your-secret-token \
  -d -p 8080:8080 mesop-app-runner;
```

## Hugging Face

If you want to test out the [Mesop App Maker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-maker) on Hugging Face,
you will need to create your own instance of the [Mesop App Runner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-runner).

You can do this by duplicating the [Mesop App Runner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-runner) on Hugging Face.

This can be done on the [Mesop App Runner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-runner) space like this:

![duplicate-hf-space](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1304dde5-3d4b-4228-8bbb-b63d8630ec0b)

Make sure to specify a `MESOP_APP_RUNNER_TOKEN`. This can be any random characters. It is needed to ensure that only people
with the token can run Mesop code on your runner instance.

The URL will be something like `https://<username>-<app-name>.hf.space`.

You will need to provide this URL as the Runner URL on [Mesop App Maker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-maker).
You will also need to provide the runner token associated with your instance on [Mesop App Maker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/richard-to/mesop-app-maker).
